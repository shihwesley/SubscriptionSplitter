# Subscription Splitter

<strong> <h3> OVERVIEW </h3> </strong>


<p>Have you ever wanted to sign up for a subscription service, but couldn't afford it?
If so, you certainly aren't alone. Our service makes utlizing these sometimes costly services
much more attainable; through the facilitation of "subscription sharing". Depending on the 
app, costs could be shared by groups of people from 2 to 1000. </p>

  <p>  Furthermore, our credential system ensures our users that the people whom they're sharing 
subscriptions with are trustworthy and not frauds. Users are reviewed on a scale similar to yelp;
if a user is unreliable or doesn't pay, then they will get a low review. You wouldn't eat at a 
restaraunt with 1 star, would you? Why share a subscription with someone whose rating is low, either?
Our app gleams by making the subscription sharing process a seamless one for all parties involved. </p>
